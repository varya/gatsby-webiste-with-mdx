## Varya Stepanova — a design systems architect

<Avatar />

<p>
  I am Varya Stepanova, a <b>design systems architect</b> with nearly 15 years of experience in frontend development,
  component-focused UI design and development, creating helpful tooling for the subject and spreading the
  practices across large organizations. I have two Master degrees — in physics and service design (Aalto
  University, <a href="https://www.idbm.aalto.fi/">IDBM</a> program), years of engineering experience and several leading
  roles behind.<br/>
  Nowadays my focus is on bringing design systems to the next level of success which includes cooperative work
  in the company development community and bridging the gap for designers, developers, and business specialists.

<p>
  At the moment, I am working as an independent consultant open for new projects.
  My roles include team leading of the design systems projects,
  technical leadership in frontend and building development infrastructure, evangelism and advocacy.
